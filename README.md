Pomodoro Timer 🍅

Pomodoro Timer is a minimalist app designed to help you manage focus and break sessions using the classic Pomodoro technique.
Perfect for studying, working, or staying productive in short bursts.

⏱️ How It Works

Each focus session lasts 25 minutes.

After that, you get a 5-minute short break.

Every 4 sessions, a long break automatically begins.

Visual and sound cues indicate when each phase starts and ends.

⚙️ Setup
